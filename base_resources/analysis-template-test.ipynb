    "### Repooling capture reactions for further sequencing. Factors to consider:\n",
    "1. What do you we want to accomplish? In most cases, we would like to get enough coverage for a number of probes for each sample. For example, the test data contains **50 probes** in total. Let's say it is sufficient if we had a coverage of **10** or more for each probe for a sample. Then, we would not want to sequence any more of that sample. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "target_coverage_count = 50\n",
    "target_coverage_key='targets_with_10_barcodes'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, we can set a goal of a fraction of total probes to reach a certain coverage rather than an absolute number of probes. For 95% of the maximum number of probes observed (47 in this case): \n",
    "```python\n",
    "target_coverage_fraction = 0.95\n",
    "target_coverage_key='targets_with_10_barcodes'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although we set our goal to 47 probes, it is likely that some sample will never reach that number regardless of how much we sequence, if there is a deletion in the region, for example. So it makes sense to set a total coverage threshold after which we don't expect more data. Looking at the plot above, it seems like after 1000 barcode counts, we would reach our goal for most samples. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "high_barcode_threshold = 10000\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another metric to use for determining if we want to sequence a sample more is the average read count per barcode count. This value indicates we have sequenced each unique molecular index in our sample so many times, so when the value is high, it is unlikely that we'd get more UMIs by sequencing the same library more. It makes more sense for a fresh MIP capture from these samples if more data is needed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "barcode_coverage_threshold=10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some samples perform very poorly for one reason or another. There are two options for these samples for repooling consideration: 1) Repool as much as we can for the next run, 2) Assuming there is a problem in the capture reaction, set up a new MIP capture reaction for these samples. It makes more sense to use option 1 if this is the first sequencing data using this library. Use option 2 if this library have been repooled at a higher volume already, but still producing poor data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "barcode_count_threshold=100 # samples below total barcode count of this value is considered low coverage\n",
    "low_coverage_action='Repool' # what to do for low coverage samples (Repool or Recapture)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sometimes a handful of samples show uneven coverage of loci, i.e. they have very good coverage of a handful of loci but poor coverage in others, which may point to a problem with the sample or the experiment in general. These samples are determined by comparing the subset of samples that reached the goal we set (completed samples) and those that have not. We look at the number of barcodes per probe for _completed_ samples and get 25th percentile (or other percentile as set) and assume that if a sample on average has this many barcodes per target, it should have reached the set goal. For example, if on average _completed_ samples, i.e. samples that cover 47 probes at 10 barcodes or more, have 10000 total barcodes, they would have ~200 (10000/47) barcodes per target covered. And if an _incomplete_ sample has 5000 total barcodes and only 10 targets covered, this value would be 500 for that sample and it would be flagged as **uneven coverage** in repooling document.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assesment_key='targets_with_1_barcodes' # coverage key to compare \"complete\" and \"incomplete\" samples\n",
    "good_coverage_quantile=0.25 # percentile to set the threshold\n",

    "### Postprocessing of called variants\n",
    "Freebayes produces high quality vcf files with haplotype based variant calls. This is important for getting more accurate calls, especially for complex regions where SNVs may overlap with indels and there may be many possible alleles as opposed to a simple biallelic SNV call.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it may be desired to \"decompose\" these complex variants for some applications. For example, if we are interested in knowing the prevalence of a specific drug resistance mutation, it would make sense to combine all variants containing this mutation even though they may be part of different haplotypes, and hence are represented in the vcf in different variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "vcf_to_tables function takes the vcf file generated by freebayes and generates allele count and coverage data in table form. It is possible to decompose and aggregate amino acid and/or nucleotide level variants. 3 files containing count data are generated: alternate_table.csv, reference_table.csv, coverage_table.csv, for alt allele, ref allele and coverage count values for each variant, respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "Variant annotation provides a gene ID (e.g. PF3D7_0709000) but it does not provide common gene names (e.g. crt). If common names are used in target files, or they are desired in general, a tab separated gene ID to gene name file can be used. **gene_name and gene_id** columns are required. If no file is provided, gene name will be the same as the gene ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### aggregate_aminoacids, default=False\n",
    "If aminoacid level aggregation is requested, it decomposes multi amino acid missense variants into single components and aggregates the alternate allele and coverage counts per amino acid change. For example, Asn75Glu change for crt gene is a known drug resistance mutation in Plasmodium falciparum. There may be 3 separate variants in the vcf file that contain this mutation: Asn75Glu, MetAsn75IleGlu, Asn75Glu_del76-80*. All three has the missense variant Asn75Glu. While the first two  are simple changes, the third is a complex change including a 5 amino acid deletion and a stop codon following Asn75Glu. In this case, it makes sense to combine the counts of the first two variants towards Asn75Glu counts but the third one is debatable because of the complexity; i.e. the drug resistance mutation Asn75Glu probably is not that improtant in that context because of the stop codon following it. So we decompose the simple changes and aggregate but leave complex changes as they are. If aminoacid aggregation is carried out, file names will contain AA tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### target_aa_annotation, default=None\n",
    "It is also possible to annotate the targeted variants (such as Asn75Glu above) in the generated tables as 'Targeted' in case some analysis should be carried out on targeted variants only. A tab separated file containing the annotation details is required for this operation. **gene_name, aminoacid_change and mutation_name** are required fields. If a variants gene_name and aminoacid_change are matching to a row in the target file, that variant will be marked as targeted and will have the correspondign mutation name. Note that if common gene name conversion (see above) is not used, the gene_name column in this file must match the actual gene ID and not the common name. It may be more convenient to keep the gene IDs in the target file as well and use that file for ID to name mapping. **aggregate_aminoacids must be set to True** for this option to be used.\n",

    "Of primary interest to most users is the QUAL field, which estimates the probability that there is a polymorphism at the loci described by the record. In freebayes, this value can be understood as 1 - P(locus is homozygous given the data). It is recommended that users use this value to filter their results, rather than accepting anything output by freebayes as ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, records are output even if they have very low probability of variation, in expectation that the VCF will be filtered using tools such as vcffilter in vcflib, which is also included in the repository under vcflib/. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "freebayes -f ref.fa aln.bam | vcffilter -f \"QUAL > 20\" >results.vcf\n",
    "\n",
    "removes any sites with estimated probability of not being polymorphic less than phred 20 (aka 0.01), or probability of polymorphism > 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulation, the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) tends to have a very sharp inflection between Q1 and Q30, depending on input data characteristics, and a filter setting in this range should provide decent performance. Users are encouraged to examine their output and both variants which are retained and those they filter out. Most problems tend to occur in low-depth areas, and so users may wish to remove these as well, which can also be done by filtering on the DP flag.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, a **minimum of 1** should be used as a min_site_qual to remove low quality sites. If a site is annotated as **targeted**, the site will be kept regardless of its qual value, however, the alternate observation counts for the site may be reset to zero depending on the min_target_site_qual value described below.\n",
