.SH NAME
plot2ann.pl \- create probability annotations from a .plot file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plot2ann.pl
.I FILE.plot FILE.ct
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBplot2ann.pl\fR writes probability annotations for the structure in \fIFILE.ct\fR using the probabilities in \fIFILE.plot\fR.  Both bases of each base pair are annotated with the probability of that pair; each single-stranded base is annotated with the probability that it is single-stranded.
.P
When stored in \fIFILE.ann\fR, the output can be used for structure annotation in \fBsir_graph\fR.
