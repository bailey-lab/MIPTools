.TH CONCENTRATIONS.PL 1 "@DATE@" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
concentrations.pl, concentrations-same.pl \- extract and normalize mole fractions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B concentrations.pl
.I PREFIX
.br
.B concentrations-same.pl
.I PREFIX
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconcentrations.pl\fR reads \fIPREFIX.conc\fR (written by \fBconcentration\fR) and normalizes the concentrations of each species.  The raw concentration of each species is divided by the sum of the concentrations so that the sum of A, B, AA, BB and AB is 1.
.P
\fBconcentrations-same.pl\fR reads a file written by \fBconcentration-same\fR and writes \fIPREFIX.A\fR, \fIPREFIX.Au\fR, \fIPREFIX.Af\fR and \fIPREFIX.AA\fR.
.P
It is recommended to use \fBhybrid2.pl\fR to run \fBhybrid\fR, \fBhybrid-ss\fR, \fBconcentration\fR, \fBconcentrations.pl\fR and \fBensemble-dg\fR and \fBensemble-ext\fR instead of running \fBconcentrations.pl\fR directly.
