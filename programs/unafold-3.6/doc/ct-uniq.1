.SH NAME
ct-uniq \- print unique structures from a .ct file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ct-uniq
.RI [ FILE ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBct-uniq\fR reads a set of stuctures in \fI.ct\fR format from each \fIFILE\fR, sorts them, and writes the unique structures to standard output.  All structures should be on the same sequence(s) or \fBct-uniq\fR may not function correctly.
.P
When no \fIFILE\fR is specified, or if \fIFILE\fR is -, \fBct-uniq\fR reads standard input.
.P
\fBct-uniq\fR is generally used to eliminate duplicates from sets of stochastic tracebacks produced by \fBhybrid\fR or \fBhybrid-ss\fR.
