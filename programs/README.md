# Programs

This folder can be used to install custom software into the MIPTools container.
By placing software into this folder, the software will be built into the
container. Currently only the
[`bcl2fastq`](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html)
software, which is used for demultiplexing BCL files, can be installed. Consult
the documentation for additional instruction.
